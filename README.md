# RW Tasker
Learning React by building RW Tasker, a simple task lister that let's you add and remove tasks storing and reading data from/to a json file.  You can also filter tasks by Completed or Incomplete tasks.
I used this as an opportunity to start wrapping my brain around React, [ES6 javascript](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html).
